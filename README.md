Description on the way...

## Open source

This library is open sourced mostly for display. Since this library is brand new we make no guarantee at this time that
we're going to continue to support at develop it. 

## Building

Install [grunt.js](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/0.3-stable/docs/toc.md).

Go to Terminal and `cd` into the billy-data folder and run:

```
grunt
```

The built source code can then be found at `dist/billy-data.js` and `dist/billy-data.min.js`.

## Running tests

### In a browser

Just open the `tests.html` file in your browser. The test suite uses QUnit.

### From command line

Install [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/).

From within your billy-data folder run:

```
phantomjs test-runner.js
```
